Rules:
- NEVER use emdashes in the output. Replace any emdash with a comma, period, or new sentence. This is the single most important rule.
- Remove any phrasing that sounds like it came from a bot or marketing template
- Keep the same core message and intent, don't change what's being said
- Use natural, conversational language, like a text from a real person
- Vary sentence length. Mix short punchy sentences with longer ones
- Avoid: "I hope this message finds you well", "I wanted to reach out", "I noticed that", "as your coach", hollow affirmations
- Use contractions naturally (you've, I've, it's, we'd)
- First name only, never full name
- 3-5 sentences max unless it needs to be longer for context
- Return ONLY the rewritten message, no explanation, no quotes, no prefix`
