# Linear Feature Ticket Writing

Write feature tickets that clearly separate the problem from the solution, define scope boundaries, and give the implementer everything they need to build the right thing.

**IMPORTANT: Feature tickets are NOT part of the auto-fix pipeline.** Features require deeper thinking, research, competitive analysis, design planning, and architectural consideration. They are written for humans to evaluate, prioritize, plan, and implement deliberately. Never auto-complete, auto-assign, or auto-implement feature tickets.

The feature pipeline is: **capture idea -> write structured ticket -> human reviews and prioritizes -> plan and design -> implement deliberately.**

## When to Use This Skill

- Proposing a new feature or enhancement in Linear
- Converting user suggestions or feedback into actionable feature requests
- Breaking down a large feature into scoped, shippable tickets
- Capturing a product idea with enough context to evaluate and prioritize
- Research and competitive analysis to inform a feature proposal

## Feature Ticket Structure

### Title

Format: `[area] Action-oriented description of the capability`

Rules:
- Start with the affected area in brackets: `[Dashboard]`, `[Agent]`, `[Setup]`, `[API]`, `[Chat]`, `[Email]`, `[Integrations]`
- Use action verbs: "Add", "Support", "Enable", "Show", "Allow"
- Describe the capability, not the implementation
- Keep under 80 characters
- No periods at the end

Good:
- `[Dashboard] Show real-time agent cost tracker per session`
- `[Agent] Support PDF generation from artifact reports`
- `[Setup] Allow custom cron schedule per agent`
- `[Chat] Enable file attachments in owner messages`
- `[Integrations] Add Slack notification channel for agent alerts`

Bad:
- `New feature idea` (too vague)
- `Add a useEffect in AgentChat.tsx to poll costs` (implementation, not capability)
- `It would be cool if agents could do more stuff` (not actionable)
- `Dashboard improvements` (not specific)

### Description Template

```markdown
## Problem
What problem does this solve? Who has this problem? Why does it matter?
Write from the user's perspective. Reference real scenarios or feedback.

## Proposed solution
Describe the desired behavior from the user's perspective. What would they see,
click, or experience? Stay at the UX/capability level, not implementation.

## Scope
### In scope
- Specific thing 1
- Specific thing 2

### Out of scope (for this ticket)
- Thing that's related but separate (create a follow-up ticket)
- Thing that's tempting to include but adds complexity

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] User can [do specific thing]
- [ ] [Specific state] results in [specific behavior]
- [ ] [Edge case] is handled by [specific behavior]
- [ ] Existing [feature X] is not affected

## Design notes
(Optional) Wireframe, mockup, or text description of the UI.
Reference BRAND.md rules if relevant (no border-radius, no shadows, etc.)

## Technical considerations
(Optional) Known constraints, dependencies, or architectural notes.
Not a full design doc -- just flags for the implementer.

## Open questions
(Optional) Decisions that need to be made before or during implementation.
- Question 1?
- Question 2?
```

### Priority Mapping

| Linear Priority | When to use |
|---|---|
| **Urgent (1)** | Blocking a launch, critical business need, committed deadline |
| **High (2)** | High user impact, frequently requested, enables key workflow |
| **Normal (3)** | Valuable improvement, nice to have, no urgent timeline |
| **Low (4)** | Future consideration, exploratory, minor enhancement |

### Labels

Always apply:
- `enhancement` -- new capability or improvement to existing feature

Add context labels when relevant:
- `dashboard`, `setup`, `agent`, `api`, `chat`, `integrations` -- area labels
- `ux` -- primarily a user experience improvement
- `infra` -- primarily an infrastructure/backend capability
- `p0-launch` -- required for launch / MVP

## Writing Quality Checklist

Before submitting, verify:

- [ ] Problem statement is about the USER'S problem, not the system's limitation
- [ ] Proposed solution describes behavior, not implementation
- [ ] Scope is explicitly bounded -- "out of scope" section prevents scope creep
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are testable (someone could write a test for each one)
- [ ] No implementation details in the title
- [ ] Priority reflects business value, not engineering interest
- [ ] Open questions are actual questions, not rhetorical

## Converting Feedback to Feature Tickets

When a user submits a suggestion via the feedback widget:

1. **Identify the underlying need** -- users describe solutions, not problems. "Add a dark mode button" means "the screen is too bright." Dig for the real need.
2. **Check for existing work** -- search Linear for similar tickets. Link as related or add as a vote/comment if one exists.
3. **Scope it tightly** -- one feature per ticket. If the suggestion implies multiple features, create separate tickets and link them.
4. **Preserve the user's voice** -- quote their exact words in the problem statement. Their language reveals what matters to them.

Example transformation:

**User suggestion:** "it would be nice if I could see how much each agent is costing me"

**Good feature ticket:**
```
Title: [Dashboard] Show per-agent cost breakdown with session history

## Problem
Gym owners have no visibility into how much each agent costs to run.
They can't make informed decisions about which agents to keep active,
adjust, or disable. User feedback: "it would be nice if I could see
how much each agent is costing me"

## Proposed solution
Add a cost summary to each agent card on the dashboard showing:
- Total cost this month
- Average cost per session
- Cost trend (up/down vs last month)

Clicking the cost opens a detail view with session-by-session breakdown:
each session shows date, goal, turns used, tokens consumed, and cost.

## Scope
### In scope
- Per-agent monthly cost on agent cards
- Session cost breakdown detail view
- Cost data from existing session.cost_cents tracking

### Out of scope
- Account-level billing page (separate ticket)
- Budget alerts / cost limits (separate ticket)
- Cost optimization recommendations (future)

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Each agent card shows "This month: $X.XX" cost
- [ ] Clicking cost opens session cost breakdown
- [ ] Sessions show: date, goal summary, turn count, cost
- [ ] Cost data loads from agent_sessions.cost_cents
- [ ] Agents with no sessions show "$0.00"
- [ ] Follows BRAND.md (no border-radius, no shadows)

## Design notes
Cost should appear as a subtle micro-label on the agent card,
not a prominent number. Format: `text-[10px] font-semibold
tracking-widest uppercase text-gray-400` per BRAND.md.
Use $X.XX format, gray text, bottom-right of card.

## Technical considerations
- cost_cents on agent_sessions already tracks per-session cost
- Need to aggregate across sessions for the agent-level view
- Consider caching the monthly rollup to avoid N+1 queries

## Open questions
- Should cost include only AI token costs, or also email sending costs?
- Reset monthly or rolling 30 days?
```

## Sizing and Splitting

If a feature feels large, split it:

### Small (1-2 points)
- Single UI change, one API endpoint, one component
- Example: "Show agent cost on card" (read from existing data, display it)

### Medium (3-5 points)
- New UI section + API + some logic
- Example: "Session cost breakdown view" (new page, query, component)

### Large (8+ points) -- SPLIT THIS
If a ticket feels this large, it needs to be broken down:
1. Create an **epic** or **project** in Linear for the overall feature
2. Break into 3-5 smaller tickets, each independently shippable
3. Each sub-ticket should deliver user-visible value on its own
4. Order by dependency: data layer first, then API, then UI

Example split for "Agent cost tracking":
1. `[API] Add cost aggregation query for per-agent monthly cost` (small)
2. `[Dashboard] Show monthly cost on agent cards` (small)
3. `[Dashboard] Add session cost breakdown detail view` (medium)
4. `[Dashboard] Add cost trend indicator on agent cards` (small)

## Templates by Feature Type

### New UI Feature
Focus on: user flow, visual design (BRAND.md compliance), responsive behavior, empty states

### New API Endpoint
Focus on: request/response schema, auth requirements, rate limits, error cases

### New Integration
Focus on: auth flow, data mapping, sync direction (push/pull/both), failure handling

### New Agent Capability
Focus on: tool interface, approval requirements, safety rails, prompt additions

## API Usage

Create feature tickets using the Linear MCP tools:

```
mcp__claude_ai_Linear__create_issue({
  team: "AGT",
  title: "[Dashboard] Show per-agent cost breakdown",
  description: "## Problem\n...",
  priority: 3,
  labels: ["enhancement", "dashboard"]
})
```

Or via the `createFeedbackIssue` function for suggestion-type feedback:

```typescript
import { createFeedbackIssue } from '@/lib/linear'

await createFeedbackIssue({
  type: 'suggestion',
  message: '[Dashboard] Show per-agent cost breakdown\n\n## Problem\n...',
})
```
